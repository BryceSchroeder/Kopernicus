New in this latest version release-215:

1.) Rings could sometimes wobble when lockedRotation was set, this has been fixed.

2.) Added parameter to lethalRadius system called "lethalRadiusAntiSpamMult", default 30.  This is the number of seconds between which warning dialogs will display if you are in the "warning zone" of a lethal scatter.  This is a planet pack feature for authors and obviously won't effect anyone in stock or other environments.

3.) Fixed Hillsphere and SOI recomputation code.  It was missing a part of the formula that had it close but not quite right.  Also added Kopernicus_Config.cfg parameter "PrincipiaFriendlySOIComputation."  This is for Principia users mainly, and recomputes the SOI regularly for bodies since Principia is an active n-body system.

4.) Added 16-bit scaled space mesh support.

5.) Minor performance improvements (Utility.GetMod was being slow so we sped it up).

6.) We had a longstanding feature request to add lethalRadius support to PQS City and City2 type objects.  Unfortunately, no matter what we do with the config parser, it does not appear to load anything but the stock values for those objects, and I have no idea why.  PR's welcome, but until we figure that out this request is on hold.


About
-----
Kopernicus is a KSP add-on that allows for modification of stock planets and the creation of new planets via modification of the system prefab.  Why is this advantageous you might ask?  Previous planet adder mods, such as Planet Factory, modified the live planetary system and had to keep multiple hacks actively running to provide these worlds.  We strive to provide the least hacky solution by introducing planets into the game in the exact same manner Squad would.  

Kopernicus is a one step process.  It is started before the planetary system is created and rewrites a property called PSystemManager.Instance.systemPrefab.  The game itself then creates *our* planetary system as if it were blessed by Squad themselves.  The mod’s function ends here, and it terminates.  Kopernicus introduced worlds require zero maintenance by third party code, all support is driven entirely by built in functionality.  This yields an incredibly stable and incredibly flexible environment for planetary creation.

One caveat exists that prevents absolute control over a planetary system.  Due to the way Squad defines how launch control and ship recovery work, a planet called Kerbin must exist and must have a reference body id of 1.  While it is easy to provide this scenario, as a star to orbit and a single planet satisfies this, any would be universe architect needs to be aware so they don’t get mystery errors. The displayed name of the body (i.e. the celestialBody.bodyName property) can be changed after the spawn of the PSystem  

Each celestial body in KSP has a property called “flightGlobalsIndex.”  This number does not directly correspond to the reference id, but is related.  Once all of the celestial bodies have been spawned, references to them are written into the localBodies list.  This list is then sorted in increasing order of the flight globals index.  The index the body is located at after the sort becomes the reference body id.

We have yet to see if removing or rearranging the other bodies causes any sort of errors in the science or contracts system.


Instructions
------------
- Copy the contents of the GameData/ folder to KSP’s GameData/ folder
- Launch KSP and enjoy!
- Please report any bugs you may find to either or both of the email addresses above.

Examples
----------
Selectively copy folders inside of [KopernicusExamples/](https://github.com/Kopernicus/KopernicusExamples/) into a GameData/KopernicusExamples/ folder.  There are a number of examples of how to use Kopernicus.

Building
----------
To build Kopernicus from source, **don't edit the project file**.

Instead, define a **Reference Path** pointing to the **root** of your local KSP install.

In Visual Studio and Rider, this can be done within the IDE UI, by going to the project properties window and then in the `Reference Path` tab.
If you want to set it manually, create a `Kopernicus.csproj.user` file next to the `src\Kopernicus\Kopernicus.csproj` file with the following content :
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="Current" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ReferencePath>Absolute\Path\To\Your\KSP\Install\Folder\Root\</ReferencePath>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
